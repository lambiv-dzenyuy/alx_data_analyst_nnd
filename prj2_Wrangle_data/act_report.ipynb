It is also seen that on average people tend to retweet post for doggo category than any other catefory of the dogs being posted on weRatDogs twitter account page. This is shows that  people tend to retweet post of dogs they are interested more often eventhogh the post might not be frequent than those frequently posted so the number of post does not influence the number of retweets or number of favorites to the dog category.\n",

The plot clearly shows that the more the number of pictures on a tweet the greater the chances that it will be retweeted.\n"
